## Flawed Disease Models of Mental Health

Does the "disease model" of every mental health condition describe immunology related aspects of a person's biological state of being? For instance, do people acquire "immunity" to a particular mental health "disease" by having it at some point in their life, or via "pharmacological inoculations?" And, are mental health conditions communicable diseases? 

These are serious questions because they highlight the fact that actual diseases and allergic reactions, do produce physiological immune responses in the body of the affected person. Therefore, any description of a disease that does not involve measures of metabolism, and of physiological attributes pertaining to haemodynamic, digestive, neuro-endocrine, and lymphatic functions in the human body, is neither a legitimate, nor a scientific approach to medicine and healthcare. But, current day disease models of "mental sanity", and of cognitive functions related to a culturally acceptable lifestyle, are based on non-scientific religious ideals and racist cultural norms from a bygone era. Furthermore, educational institutions and medical licensing agencies still haven't deprecated obsolete theories and models of human health, especially when the topic of healthy living involves socio-economic factors that are not centered upon or related to, any biologically measurable factors. 

However, modern day psychologists and psychiatrists have continued to try and gain reflected glory among their medical peers and scientific researchers, by adopting bastardized terminologies from medical science, such as the word "trauma", to indicate that sociological disagreements or conflicts among individuals that can lead to anger or grief, are to be thought of as a "laceration" or a "wound", within the "psyche" of those aggrieved persons. The actual topics of allergy, chronic medical ailments like long-COVID, and the negative effects of inordinately long wait times that can be anywhere between a year to three years to see a medical specialist in countries like Canada, are still being neglected by public healthcare policy makers. 

The fact remains, that the following approach to "healthcare and long-term care", in provinces like Ontario, Canada, are procedural steps of a systematic method for perniciously murdering targeted individuals with genocidal intentions, with such steps being specifically designed and continued to be directed against ethnic minorities and dissidents, in countries like Canada. 

- Create public policies that cause a select group of people to suffer the corrosive effects of poverty and deprivation 

- Have public service units target a person from the selected group of people, label them as being "unruly" or "at risk", and force the targeted persons into a "community program" for issues like "addiction" or "anger management" enforced via social services 

- Repeatedly suggest to the targeted person, using subtle and direct methods of gas-lighting, that they need to seek continuous "psychological counseling and psychiatric therapy" 

- Have psychiatric doctors prescribe a high-dosage cocktail of drugs to the target person, such as and not limited to:

  - escitalopram (Cipralex) plus,  
  
  - dexamphetamine (Vyvanse) or a mix of levo and dextro amphetamines (Ritalin) plus,  
  
  - zopiclone (Imovane) plus,  
  
  - lorazepam (Ativan) plus,  
  
  - olanzapine (Zyprexa) plus,  
  
  - methotrimeprazine (Nozinan)  
  
- Repeatedly have psychiatric doctors and medical professionals strongly suggest to the target person that they are a patient of a severe mental illness; choose any label for a psychiatric illness or a disorder that could be used for prescribing stronger and more dangerous anti-psychotic drugs, such as and not limited to: 

  - haloperidol (Haldol)  
  
  - chlorpromazine (Thorazine)  
  
  - clozapine (Leponex)  
  
  - quetiapine (Seroquel)  
  
- Downplay the negative side-effects of prescribed psychotropic and neuro-suppressive drugs, especially the side-effects of weight gain, lethargy, drowsiness, sexual dysfunctions, low blood pressure, memory loss, blackouts, and other "'non-lethal' drug-drug interactions" that slowly deteriorate the quality of the targeted person's life, income based work, and identity

- Prescribe increasingly higher doses and narcotic combinations of drugs for extended periods of time, to cause behavioral ticks and neuro-endocrine imbalance 

- Have policing services intervene in the target person's life frequently with subtle forms of harassment 
 
- Create an event so that the target person can be consigned to a psychiatric treatment facility by force of law 

- Conduct surgical, biochemical, electromechanical, and psychological experiments on the person till they die or can be released back into the community in immobilized form 

In hindsight, it can be observed that deeply flawed education, healthcare, judiciary, and political governance systems in countries like Canada, didn't come about due to accidental outcomes of ignorance or carelessness. Those "flaws" have been arduously maintained and propagated as "'the golden standard' of high quality living in First World Countries", as a systematic means to prune and weed-out vulnerable individuals, based on racist ideologies and cunningly engineered designs put forth by the "Supreme Leaders" of Anglo-Saxon communities.
